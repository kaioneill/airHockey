Work in progress using p5.js and node.js

Experimenting with node.js to explore a server/client environment, attempting to create a multiplayer airhockey game over a local socket server.

Looks for node.js node_modules/ directory in the directory it's run from. Start the socket server (server.js) and then open two instances of the client webpage (which runs client.js)
